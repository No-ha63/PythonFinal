# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Finding the Epicenter

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Using seismic data, I will use triangulation to locate the epicenter of an Earthquake. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I plan on using VSCode to build and test the code. I need data of seismic activity so I can test and run. I plan on just using the terminal of VSCode to execute. If I end up doing really well, then maybe that can be something to improve. In theory, the code can read seismic data, find the surface/boby waves, and use that to get a distance from the epicenter. From that, we can then use triangulation. This is where you use three seismographs to draw circles using the distance. Where the 3 circles overlap, that's where the epicenter was. I plan on using turtle to illustrate this. There is also a python module, ObsPY, that is used to display/read seismic data. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not doing

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

By myself

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I get everything with turtles worked out and set up.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I get the data and can make a few earthquakes

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope I can get the program working for a large amount of Earthquakes.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
First I get the siesmic data for the world or an area. Next I set up a turtles map and world coordinates using what area I am looking at. After this I will beging to read the data and trying to find ways to tell where the body/surface waves start. With that I can then get the distance from the epicenter. Lastly I will get turtles to animate the cirlce drawing to find the epicenter. If this all gets accomplished, more can be done. 
Some things to research: getting seismic data, reading the data, some turtles aspects to get that correct. The distance coordintations from Earth to screen.
