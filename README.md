# PythonFinal
Work for the final


Issues:
Getting the background to work. I ended up just registering it as a shape and getting it to the midpoint. 

Some surprises. I had to do some research for the inner working of seismographs and the process, but I'm honestly pretty proud with the final result. For my skill and knowledge of geology, I think it is pretty good. Is it perfect, no, but I'm not mad about it. 

I enjoyed the whole process. It was a more intense and risky one, but it had good payoff. I enjoyed that it was combining a few classes that I am in right now. I learned a lot about Earthquake data, the systems used to locate epicenters, and that it really isn't extremely complicated. Along with that, I learned a few other little things.
